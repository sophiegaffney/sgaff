<p> Is a campaign set up in 2017, that takes pre-loved clothing to create gender neutral garments.
Over a million tonnes of clothing every year is ditched by UK consumers and we can reduce this by recycling our clothes. 
Many charities take second-hand clothing to sell on via shops or clothing banks. 
However we are different, we believe times have changed and gender neutral is the new trend. 
By filling in the donate form you will able to tell us when you want a free collection of unwanted clothes that we can reuse to create gender neutral garments, that are lacking in our society today. </p>
